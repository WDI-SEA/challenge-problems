# Direction:

# Given an amount of change, determine the minimum number of coins required to make that change

# Examples:

# greedy(65) --> 4 `(2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickle)`
# greedy(5) --> 1 `(1 nickle)`

# Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V cents, and we have an infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .., Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change? If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.


# Input: coins[] = {25, 10, 5}, V = 30
# Output: Minimum 2 coins required We can use one coin of 25 cents and one of 5 cents 

# Input: coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}, V = 11
# Output: Minimum 2 coins required We can use one coin of 6 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents

    # number of coins required for i value.
    # So table[V] will have result
    table = [0 for i in range(V + 1)]
 
    # Base case (If given value V is 0)
    table[0] = 0
 
    # Initialize all table values as Infinite
